This website describes a powerful way to manage APIs that is inexpensive and high-performing. But up to now, unfortunately, it hasn't been particularly easy to use.

We provide explanations and tools here to fix that. Not only is this approach surprisingly easy, it excels at supporting APIs that are built with gRPC and Protocol Buffers.

This discussion starts with a review of [API Management](/api-management) and an aside discussing what's special about [gRPC API Management](/grpc-api-management).

Then we look at Google's [Service Infrastructure](/service-infrastructure) and the [Extensible Service Proxies](/extensible-service-proxies). These are the key parts of our API management solution.

As we look at them, we also see a few gaps. One way that we fill those gaps is with [q](/the-q-tool), a command-line tool that helps us configure and demonstrate Service Infrastructure-based API management.
[q](/the-q-tool) supports a [quickstart](/quickstart) that Google Cloud users can use to quickly get a sample managed
service running on Cloud Run. Try it!

Thanks for joining us, and please post any feedback to
[our issues page](https://github.com/serviceinfra/serviceinfra.github.io/issues).
