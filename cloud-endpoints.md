title: Cloud Endpoints
---
Cloud Endpoints is a Google API management product that uses Service Infrastructure to manage APIs on Google Cloud and external platforms.

Cloud Endpoints is based on tools and practices that Google developed over many years to manage its own APIs. When Cloud Endpoints was released in 2016, most API developers used tools and methods that were very different from Google's, making this a difficult fit. But now, with the growth of gRPC and Buf, more and more developers are using Protocol Buffers to design their APIs, and it's worth revisiting Cloud Endpoints to see an example
of Protobuf-first API management.
